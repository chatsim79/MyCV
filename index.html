                <p>Hi, I'm Simon and I'm from Northern Ireland, where I grew up during The Troubles. I left to study in 
                    Edinburgh from 1998 where I completed a Honours Degree in Mechanical Engineering. After my degree I 
                    completed a Chartered Mangers Institute Level 5 Diploma in Management as a 6 month post grad course.</p>
                <p>Once I was armed with bits of paper, I went to work in the oil industry as a Measurement/Logging While Drilling 
                    Engineer. This consisted of utilising electronic sensors above the drill bit which read the physical properties 
                    of the rock, such as gamma signature, resistivity, density, and porosity. This data was presented as logs 
                    (very long graphs), ASCII/LAS data and of course, we used a piece of complex database software to achieve it, 
                    which i now suspect was SQL based given the nature of the Query logic. This job took me all over the world, 
                    having worked in the U.S., Europe and the Middle East. Below are some photos of me at work.</p>

            <p>Outside of work, I live in a small town in Scotland, having moved out of Edinburgh to the countryside during the pandemic. 
            I enjoy playing the guitar, and have done since i was 11. Some pics of my Man Cave below which I'm unjustifiably proud of 
            (for more info on that, see "An Irish Guitar Player in Scotland" in the My Web Design section). Logic and critical thinking 
            appeal to me. I am intensely interested and engaged in abstract tasks such as the Python coding we did in level one and the 
            database/SQL tasks from level 3. Figuring out how to manipulate code to make it do what i want is very rewarding.</p>
